We started our food stand business on May 26,2020 at Sta, Anna Davao Branch to provide crispy and affordable chicken with many more to the students near at our physical store. With that, we become popular in the field of fried chickens industry and made a lot of friends through our customers. We also do deliveries to cater all of our customers who want to taste the food in our menu's.</h1>
